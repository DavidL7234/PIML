Coarse-grained modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by physics-informed machine learning

aa_ref.pdb:
The PDB describes the all-atom spike-protein structure, and each atomâ€™s beta value is the corresponding CG bead index that it maps to. The CG bead coordinate is the center of mass of its corresponding atom group.
